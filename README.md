This is the video game I am creating!

The premise involves a sentient rubber ball that awakens in a rubber ball factory in the city of Citysburg.
In order to run (should run on mac or pc even though it's called pc):
    1. Download pc.zip
    2. Extract all from pc.zip
    3. open Bally.exe and see the beginnings of the first level of my game
    
I haven't implimented a home screen yet so you'll just have to alt tab to exit the game when you're done. 

I plan on implimenting a lot of physics in this game inclusing realistic material interaction and the bernoulli effect.
